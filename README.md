## Refreshing Authentication

- On sign-in or sign-up, a long-lived Refresh JWT and short-lived Access JWT are generated by the Apollo server.
- The Refresh token is stored in a cookie.
- The Access token is included in the graphQL response.
- On the client, the Access token is stored in a global variable for subsequent requests.
- Using Apollo Client middleware, the Access token is validated before every request.
- If the Access token is expired, the middleware fetches a new one from the express server.
  - which validates the Refresh token before sending a new Access token.
- The Refresh token can be invalidated by incrementing the version.
  - This is done by making a graphQL request of:
    - mutation { revokeRefreshToken(id: "some-user-id") }
  - This will prevent the Access token from refreshing until the user signs in again.

2. Run `npm run deploy -- -n`
3. Select `Demo server`
4. Complete the prompts
5. Copy `HTTP` endpoint
6. Paste endpoint in `.env` as `PRISMA_ENDPOINT` value
